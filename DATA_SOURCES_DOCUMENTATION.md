## **üîç DATA VALIDATION & QUALITY ASSURANCE**

### **Source Verification**
- ‚úÖ **Official Government Sources**: Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, Ministry of Health
- ‚úÖ **International Organizations**: WHO, UN Population Division, World Bank
- ‚úÖ **Peer-Reviewed Publications**: PMC indexed studies, medical journals
- ‚úÖ **Recent Data**: All sources from 2015-2024, with preference for 2024 data

### **Data Cross-Referencing**
- Multiple sources consulted for key statistics
- Consistency checks between WHO and Kenya government data
- Historical trend validation where available
- **Cross-validation conducted for enhanced AI prompts (August 2024)**:
  - Population figures validated across UN, World Bank, and demographic sites
  - Disease burden statistics cross-checked between WHO Kenya and KNBS
  - Health system structure confirmed through multiple government sources

### **Limitations & Disclaimers**
- **Rural/Urban estimates**: Based on World Bank projections, may vary from census data
- **Disease burden data**: Based on registered deaths in health facilities, may underrepresent community deaths
- **County variations**: Significant disparities exist across Kenya's 47 counties
- **Temporal factors**: Some data points from different years due to survey cycles

## **üìù PROMPT IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

### **Context vs Analysis Data**
```python
# CORRECT: Real Kenya data provides context
REAL_KENYA_CONTEXT = {
    "population": "56.4 million (UN 2024)",
    "disease_burden": "Pneumonia #1, Cancer #2, CVD #3 (KNBS 2024)",
    "health_system": "47 counties, 6-tier structure"
}

# PRIMARY: SHIF document data for actual analysis
def analyze_contradictions(extracted_shif_data):
    # Find contradictions IN the extracted SHIF data
    # Use Kenya context to assess clinical impact
    # Don't assume anything not in extracted data
```

### **Prompt Structure**
1. **Medical Expertise Definition** - Clinical specializations and standards
2. **Kenya Health Context** - Real data for clinical reasoning
3. **SHIF Data Analysis** - Primary focus on extracted document data
4. **Output Framework** - Structured analysis with confidence metrics

---

## **üîÑ UPDATE PROCEDURES**

### **Data Refresh Schedule**
- **Annual**: Population estimates, health survey data
- **Quarterly**: Disease burden statistics where available
- **As Available**: Policy documents, health system changes

### **Source Monitoring**
