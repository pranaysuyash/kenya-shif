     - Why we use multi-level deduplication (exact, fuzzy, semantic)
     - Data processing pipeline explanation
     - AI integration decisions and model selection
     - Service structuring rationale (920 rules)
     - Storage and caching strategy
     - UI/UX architecture decisions
     - Deployment strategy across platforms
     - Performance optimization choices
     - Error handling and resilience patterns

### 2. **Expanded Documentation Viewer in Streamlit App**
   - **Files Updated**: `streamlit_comprehensive_analyzer.py`
   - **Previous State**: 7 documentation files in dropdown
   - **New State**: 15 documentation files in dropdown
   - **Added Files**:
     1. üìñ README
     2. üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Flow
     3. üîÑ System Flow Explanation
     4. ‚öôÔ∏è Design Decisions & Architecture (NEW)
     5. üìã Implementation Summary
     6. üöÄ Quick Deployment
     7. üìö Deployment Guide
     8. ‚úÖ Deployment Readiness Checklist

### 3. **Cleaned Up Interview-Related Content**
   - **File Updated**: `SYSTEM_FLOW_EXPLANATION.md`
   - **Removed**: Section 8 "For Assignment/Interview Prep"
   - **Why**: Focused documentation on system functionality, not portfolio/interview use
   - **Renumbered**: Previous section 9 (References) is now section 8

## How Documentation Now Works

### In-App Access
1. **Sidebar Menu**: Users select any of 15 documentation files from dropdown
2. **Button Click**: "üìñ Open Selected Doc" button opens full-screen view
3. **Main Window**: Documentation renders in main area (not sidebar)
4. **Close Button**: "‚úï Close Documentation" button returns to normal tabs

### Documentation Organization by Purpose

| Category | Files | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Getting Started** | README, Quick Deployment | Entry point for new users |
| **System Understanding** | System Architecture, System Flow, Design Decisions | Learn how system works and why |
| **Implementation** | Implementation Summary, Architecture Overview, Production Files Guide | Technical deep dive |
| **Deployment** | Deployment Guide, Readiness Checklist, Deployment Summary | Deploy to production |
| **Reference** | Directory Structure, Current State Analysis, Final Submission Complete, Repository Cleanup | Project structure and status |

## Design Decisions Documentation Highlights

### What Problem Does It Solve?
Users and developers often ask:
- ‚ùì "Why use Tabula for some pages and PyPDF2 for others?"
- ‚ùì "Why deduplication? Isn't it unnecessary?"
- ‚ùì "Why OpenAI instead of local models?"
- ‚ùì "Why 920 structured rules?"
- ‚ùì "Why cache AI results?"

### How It Answers Them
Each major decision includes:
1. **The Problem**: What challenge did this solve?
2. **The Solution**: What was chosen and why?
3. **Trade-offs**: What pros/cons were considered?
4. **Why This Approach**: Benefits over alternatives
5. **Results**: What was achieved

## Technical Implementation

### Cached Results Auto-Load
Added to app startup:
```python
# On app startup, automatically load cached analysis results
if not self.results:
    cache_file = Path("unified_analysis_output.json")
    if cache_file.exists():
        try:
            with open(cache_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                self.results = json.load(f)
            st.sidebar.success("‚úÖ Loaded cached analysis results")
        except Exception as e:
            st.sidebar.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Could not load cache: {e}")
```

### Documentation Display
- Full-screen view in main window
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
- Navigation header with close button
- Proper session state management
