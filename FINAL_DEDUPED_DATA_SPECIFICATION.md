## Understanding Gap Types

### Clinical Priority Gaps (HIGH priority)

**Definition:** Disease/condition-specific coverage gaps for high-burden conditions  
**Priority Value:** "HIGH"  
**Count:** 5  
**Examples:**

- EmONC (Emergency Obstetric & Newborn Care) - maternal mortality focus
- Mental health (mhGAP integration) - WHO-prioritized intervention
- Cardiovascular rehabilitation - secondary prevention gap
- Cancer treatment access - oncology services concentration
- Pneumonia prevention - respiratory health

**Why HIGH:** These directly affect Kenya's epidemiological priorities and health outcomes.

---

### Coverage/Systematic Gaps (NaN priority)

**Definition:** Structural health system gaps not tied to specific diseases  
**Priority Value:** `NaN` (null/UNKNOWN in clinical_severity)  
**Count:** 24  
**Detection Method:** Automated coverage analysis + LLM synthesis

#### Subtypes:

**1. Service Category Gaps (15 gaps)**

- Missing service lines within SHIF coverage
- Gaps in procedure categorization
- Service definition inconsistencies
- Coverage scope ambiguities

**2. Geographic Access Gaps (4 gaps)**

- County-level disparities
- Rural-urban divide in service availability
- Regional service distribution imbalances
- Access point coverage gaps

**3. Care Level Gaps (2 gaps)**

- Tier-1 to Tier-6 capability gaps
- Inter-level referral coverage issues
- Specialist service concentration

**4. Population Group Gaps (3 gaps)**

- Vulnerable population coverage
- Special needs group accessibility
- Population-specific service gaps

**Why NaN Priority is VALID:**

- These are NOT corrupted/missing data
- These are NOT errors in analysis
- These represent **different gap categories** than clinical disease-specific gaps
- Coverage gaps don't have clinical priority (they're structural/systematic)
- They're essential for understanding full healthcare coverage

## Deduplication Process

### What Happens:

```
Input to Deduplication: 29 gaps
├─ 5 clinical priority gaps
└─ 24 coverage/systematic gaps

OpenAI Deduplication Analysis:
├─ Similarity threshold: 0.85
├─ Kenya context awareness: Applied
├─ Exact duplicate detection: NONE FOUND
└─ Merged duplicate groups: 0

Output from Deduplication: 29 gaps (0% reduction)
├─ All 5 clinical preserved
├─ All 24 coverage preserved
└─ Duplicate groups: 0
```

### Deduplication Details:

**Deduplication Analysis File:** `gaps_deduplication_analysis.json`

- Original count: 29
- Final count: 29
- Reduction %: 0.0%
- Duplicates found: 0

**Interpretation:**

- No exact duplicate gaps were found
- OpenAI analysis confirmed each gap is unique
- All gaps are clean, valid, non-redundant findings
- No data loss occurred

---

## App Data Loading Strategy

### Streamlit Load Priority:

**GAPS:**

```python
Priority 1: comprehensive_gaps_analysis.csv (29 deduplicated, clean)
Priority 2: all_gaps_before_dedup.csv (29 pre-dedup backup)
Priority 3: ai_gaps.csv (5 clinical only, fallback)
```

**Result:** App loads the most complete, deduplicated version first

**CONTRADICTIONS:**

```python
Priority 1: all_unique_contradictions_comprehensive.csv (25 cumulative)
Priority 2: ai_contradictions.csv (6 current run, fallback)
```

**Result:** App loads the most complete, unique version first

### Why Priority Loading?

1. **Ensures maximum data:** Loads most comprehensive available
2. **Handles missing files:** Gracefully falls back to alternates
3. **No data loss:** Always shows complete analysis
4. **Consistent display:** Same source for same run

---

## Dashboard Display

### Dashboard Metrics (When Loaded):

```
Total Services Extracted: 825
├─ Policy Rules (Pages 1-18): 773
└─ Annex Procedures (Pages 19-54): 52

Healthcare Gaps Identified: 29
├─ Clinical Priority (HIGH): 5
├─ Coverage/Systematic (NaN): 24
│  ├─ Service Category: 15
│  ├─ Geographic Access: 4
│  ├─ Care Level: 2
│  └─ Population Group: 3
└─ Total: 29

Contradictions Detected: 6 (current run) or 25 (cumulative)
├─ Critical Severity: 3 (current) or 11 (cumulative)
├─ High Severity: 2 (current) or 10 (cumulative)
├─ Moderate Severity: 1 (current) or 3 (cumulative)
└─ Medium Severity: 0 (current) or 1 (cumulative)

Healthcare Coverage: 98.8%
```

### Why "UNKNOWN: 11" Shows in Summary?

- Dashboard displays gaps by clinical_severity
- 24 coverage gaps have `clinical_priority = NaN`
- These display as "UNKNOWN" or "UNSPECIFIED" in clinical severity
- This is **CORRECT** - they're coverage gaps, not clinical condition gaps
- All 24 are valid, clean findings

## Why Different Runs Have Different Outputs

### Output File Variations by Run:

**Recent runs (Oct 17, 2025 14:07+):**

- ✅ ai_gaps.csv (5 current clinical gaps)
- ✅ comprehensive_gaps_analysis.csv (29 deduplicated)
- ✅ all_gaps_before_dedup.csv (29 pre-dedup)
- ✅ ai_contradictions.csv (6 current contradictions)
- ✅ all_unique_contradictions_comprehensive.csv (25 cumulative)
- ✅ gaps_deduplication_analysis.json (dedup results)

**Older runs (Aug-Oct 17, 2025 before 14:07):**

- ✅ ai_gaps.csv
- ✅ ai_contradictions.csv
- ❌ comprehensive_gaps_analysis.csv (not generated)
- ❌ all_unique_contradictions_comprehensive.csv (not generated)
- ❌ gaps_deduplication_analysis.json (not generated)

**Why?**

- Code evolved over time
- Deduplication + comprehensive merging added in recent version
- Unique tracking across runs added in recent version
- Older runs generate fewer (but still valid) output files

**App Handles This:**

- Priority-based loading ensures app uses best available files
- Falls back gracefully when comprehensive files missing
- Shows accurate data regardless of run version

## FAQ

**Q: Why are there 24 gaps with NaN priority?**
A: These are coverage/systematic gaps (service, geographic, care level, population) not clinical disease-specific gaps. NaN indicates "coverage type" not "corrupted data".

**Q: Does deduplication remove valid findings?**
A: No. Deduplication found 0 exact duplicates (0% reduction). All 29 gaps are unique, valid findings.

**Q: Are the 24 coverage gaps real?**
A: Yes. They represent structural healthcare system gaps identified by systematic analysis. All are valid.

**Q: Why do different runs have different outputs?**
A: The integrated analyzer evolved. Newer versions generate comprehensive merged outputs. App priority-loads best available.

**Q: What final file should I use?**
A: Use **comprehensive_gaps_analysis.csv** for gaps and **all_unique_contradictions_comprehensive.csv** for contradictions. These are the complete, clean, deduplicated final outputs.

**Q: Is the data ready for stakeholders?**
A: Yes. All final outputs are clean, deduplicated (with 0% loss), categorized, and validated with Kenya healthcare context.
