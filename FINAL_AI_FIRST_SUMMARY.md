## üèÜ CORE TRANSFORMATION: From Text Parser to Medical Expert

### ‚ùå **Before: AI as Expensive Regex**
```python
# WASTED AI USAGE - $20/hour AI doing 10¬¢ work
prompt = "Extract tariff from: KES 10,650 per session"
response = {"tariff": 10650}  # Basic parsing
```

### ‚úÖ **After: AI as Healthcare Policy Expert**
```python
# PROPER AI USAGE - Medical domain expertise
prompt = """
You are a nephrologist reviewing dialysis policies.
Both hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration treat ESRD.
Should they have different session limits?
Apply clinical reasoning to identify contradictions.
"""
response = "3 vs 2 sessions violates clinical equivalence"
```
