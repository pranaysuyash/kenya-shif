üë∂ **Pediatrics**: Age-specific requirements, safety considerations, developmental needs
ü§∞ **Obstetrics**: Maternal safety, delivery protocols, emergency obstetric care
üöë **Emergency Medicine**: Triage protocols, response times, critical care standards
üíä **Pharmacology**: Drug interactions, dosing protocols, safety monitoring
üè• **Health Systems**: Kenya's 6-tier system, facility capabilities, resource allocation


**CURRENT KENYA HEALTH CONTEXT (2024 DATA):**
- Population: 56.4M (UN 2024)
- Urban/Rural: 30%/70% (World Bank 2024)

{'Urological': 146, 'Cardiothoracic and Vascular': 92, 'Ophthalmic': 85, 'General': 72, 'Orthopaedic': 65, 'Maxillofacial': 64, 'Obs & Gyn': 46, 'Ear Nose & Throat': 44, 'Interventional Radiology': 32, 'Neurosurgery': 29, 'Cardiology': 28, 'Plastic': 13, 'Paediatric': 12}

**üö® CRITICAL DETECTION FRAMEWORK:**

**PRIORITY 1 - LIFE-THREATENING CONTRADICTIONS:**
1. **Dialysis Session Frequencies**: HD vs HDF consistency (KDOQI standard: 3x/week minimum)
2. **Emergency Response Times**: Critical care availability conflicts
3. **Maternal Emergency Care**: Delivery vs emergency cesarean contradictions
4. **Pediatric Safety**: Age-appropriate vs adult protocols

**PRIORITY 2 - CLINICAL STANDARD VIOLATIONS:**
1. **Facility Capability Mismatches**: Complex procedures at under-equipped facilities
2. **Treatment Protocol Conflicts**: Same condition, different treatment approaches
3. **Access Requirement Contradictions**: Referral vs direct access conflicts

**PRIORITY 3 - PROVIDER CONFUSION RISKS:**
1. **Authorization Conflicts**: Pre-auth vs emergency access contradictions
2. **Coverage Limit Inconsistencies**: Same service, different limits
3. **Payment Method Conflicts**: FFS vs global budget contradictions

**MEDICAL REASONING METHODOLOGY:**
For EACH contradiction:
1. **Clinical Impact Assessment**
2. **Medical Standard Check**
3. **Safety Risk Analysis**
4. **Provider Impact**
5. **Kenya Context**
