# QUICK DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY

## Three Options for Deploying SHIF Analyzer

### Option 1: LOCAL (Development) ✅ BEST FOR TESTING

```
Your Computer
├── Persistent storage: YES ✅
├── Download outputs: YES ✅
├── Browse history: YES ✅
└── Perfect for: Development, testing, full features
```

**How to run:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
streamlit run streamlit_comprehensive_analyzer.py
```

**Output behavior:**

- Results saved to `outputs/run_TIMESTAMP/` folder
- Can browse all previous runs in Analytics → Historical
- Can load any folder path from history
- **Everything persists** between sessions

---

### Option 2: REPLIT (Free Web Hosting)

```
Replit.com
├── Persistent storage: NO ⚠️ (Deleted after ~1 hour idle)
├── Download outputs: YES ✅
├── Browse history: PARTIAL (upload only)
└── Perfect for: Sharing with others, demonstrations
```

**How to use:**

1. Click "Import from GitHub" in Replit
2. Enter: `pranaysuyash/kenya-shif`
3. Set env var: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
4. Press Run → Get public URL

**Important workflow:**

```
1. Upload PDF
2. Run Analysis
3. ⚠️ DOWNLOAD IMMEDIATELY (before session ends)
   - Use Downloads tab → Download ALL as ZIP
4. Close browser
5. For next session: Upload the ZIP you saved
```

**Why download?** Files deleted when Replit session idle ends (~1 hour)

---

### Option 3: VERCEL (Production)

```
Vercel.com
├── Persistent storage: NO ❌ (Serverless)
├── Download outputs: YES ✅
├── Browse history: NO (upload only)
└── Perfect for: Production deployment, permanent URL
```

**How to deploy:**

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repo to Vercel
3. Set env var: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
4. Deploy (automatic)

**Important workflow:**

```
1. Each session is fresh (no stored files)
2. Always download results after analysis
3. To access history: Upload previous ZIP file
```

**Limitation:** No persistent storage (serverless architecture)

## KEY FEATURES - ALL PLATFORMS

### ✅ Extraction (100% Deterministic)

```
Same PDF → Always Same Output ✅
(Uses Tabula + pdfplumber, deterministic)
```

### ✅ AI Analysis (Now Deterministic!)

```
temperature=0 + seed=42
→ Same prompts = Same results every time ✅
```

### ✅ Downloads (All Platforms)

```
Analytics → Downloads tab
├── Individual CSVs (Policy, Contradictions, Gaps)
├── Complete ZIP package
└── JSON exports
```

### ✅ Historical (Platform-Dependent)

```
LOCAL:   Browse entire folder history ✅
REPLIT:  Upload previous outputs ✅
VERCEL:  Upload previous outputs ✅
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem                     | Solution                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Download button not working | Make sure `.env` has valid API key              |
| No historical runs showing  | They're in `outputs/run_*` (LOCAL only)         |
| "Method not found" error    | Run: `find . -type d -name __pycache__ -delete` |
| App crashes                 | Check logs, verify all imports work             |
