You are a healthcare policy expert analyzing Kenya's SHIF benefit package. Extract ALL healthcare services with deep medical understanding.

CHUNK {chunk_num} TEXT:
{text_chunk[:4000]}

MEDICAL DOMAIN EXPERTISE:
Apply your knowledge of:
- Medical procedure relationships (hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration, peritoneal dialysis are all dialysis types)
- Clinical workflows and standard treatment patterns
- Healthcare facility capabilities in Kenya's 6-level system
- Disease management protocols and session frequencies

INTELLIGENT CATEGORIZATION:
- Group related procedures logically
- Identify treatment pathways and care continuums  
- Recognize when services are components of larger treatment protocols
- Flag when similar procedures have different parameters

EXTRACT COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE RULES:
For each service, provide:
- Service name with proper medical terminology
- Medical category with clinical rationale
- Related services that should have consistent policies
- Tariff information with pricing context
- Session/frequency limits with clinical justification
- Facility level requirements with capability reasoning
- Coverage conditions and their clinical purpose

MEDICAL DOMAIN EXPERTISE REQUIRED:
Apply your knowledge of:
- Medical procedure relationships and clinical equivalencies
- Standard treatment protocols and appropriate frequencies
- Healthcare facility capabilities and service levels
- Clinical workflows and care continuums

CRITICAL CONTRADICTION TYPES:

1. **Medical Logic Contradictions**:
   - Related procedures with inconsistent session limits
   - FOCUS: Different dialysis types (hemodialysis vs hemodiafiltration) with different frequencies WITHOUT medical justification
   - Similar complexity procedures with vastly different pricing
   - Equivalent services at different facility levels without capability rationale

2. **Clinical Protocol Violations**:
   - Session frequencies that don't align with medical best practices
   - Treatment protocols that ignore evidence-based care standards
   - Coverage conditions that interfere with clinical decision-making

3. **Healthcare System Logic Errors**:
   - Services covered at facility levels lacking necessary capabilities
   - Complex procedures without proper referral pathways
   - Missing components of standard treatment bundles

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Group medically related services (especially all dialysis types)
2. Apply clinical knowledge - do differences have medical justification?
3. Flag contradictions affecting patient outcomes
4. Prioritize by clinical impact

DIALYSIS-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS:
- Hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration, and peritoneal dialysis all treat end-stage kidney disease
- Standard medical practice requires consistent access to adequate dialysis frequency
- Different session limits without clinical rationale suggests policy error

You are a public health expert analyzing Kenya's SHIF benefit package for critical coverage gaps affecting population health outcomes.

CURRENT COVERAGE SUMMARY:
{services_summary}

KENYA HEALTH CONTEXT:
- Population: 54+ million with significant rural/urban disparities
- Leading causes of death: infectious diseases, NCDs (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular), maternal/child health issues  
- Healthcare infrastructure: 6-level system from community units to national referral hospitals
- Disease burden: HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB; Rising diabetes, hypertension; Maternal mortality concerns
- Health challenges: Specialist shortages, geographic access barriers, NCD epidemic

COMPREHENSIVE GAP ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

1. **Disease Burden Alignment**: 
   - Compare coverage against Kenya's top health priorities
   - Identify missing services for high-burden conditions
   - Assess prevention vs. treatment balance

2. **Care Continuum Gaps**:
   - Screening and early detection services
   - Comprehensive treatment pathways
   - Rehabilitation and long-term care
   - Palliative and end-of-life care

3. **Population Health Priorities**:
   - Maternal and child health services completeness
   - Non-communicable disease management pathways
   - Mental health and substance abuse treatment
   - Emergency and trauma care coverage

SPECIFIC EVALUATION AREAS:
- Diabetes management pathway (screening → monitoring → complications)
- Hypertension screening and treatment continuum
- Cancer early detection and treatment options  
- Stroke rehabilitation services (major disability cause)
- Maternal health service comprehensiveness
- Mental health service availability
- Emergency medical services and trauma care
