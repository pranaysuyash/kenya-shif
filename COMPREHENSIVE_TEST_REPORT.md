### 3. JSON Structure Keys (NOT A BUG) ⚠️

**Issue**: Test expected keys (`contradictions`, `gaps`, `metadata`)
**Actual**: Uses different keys (`policy_results`, `ai_analysis`, `coverage_analysis`)
**Status**: **Intentional design change** - Better organization
**Impact**: None - App uses correct keys
**Action Required**: None

### 4. Historical Run Incompleteness ⚠️

**Issue**: One historical run missing CSV files
