  "executive_summary": "As Dr. Margaret Kobia: Immediate priority for successful SHIF implementation is to stabilize service delivery and provider cash flows, simplify and transparently communicate entitlements, and fast-track a small set of system fixes that remove major operational blockages. Simultaneously establish a disciplined governance, monitoring and risk-mitigation architecture that can deliver visible wins within 90 days while building toward financial and institutional sustainability. Priority outcomes in the first 90 days: uninterrupted access to PHC, predictable payments to providers, clear pre‑authorization rules, and an operational claims/payments pipeline. These actions protect public trust and create political space for deeper reforms.",
