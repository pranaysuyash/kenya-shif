Thank you — I’ll respond as Dr. Grace Kiprotich. Below is a concise, operationally focused priority plan to close the highest-impact gaps in Kenya’s health services, aligned to the data you provided and to Kenya’s governance (47 counties, 6-tier system) and financing realities.

Executive summary (one line)
- Prioritise six high-impact, feasible service packages (cardiovascular rehabilitation, cancer early detection & referral, pneumonia prevention & acute care, emergency obstetric care, mental health integration, trauma/urgent care) plus five cross-cutting system enablers (workforce, financing, referral + transport, essential medicines/oxygen, digital health), implemented through phased county-led scale-up with national technical leadership.

Priority package-by-package recommendations

1) Cardiovascular rehabilitation (CVD_REHAB_CRITICAL_001)
- Why: CVD = 25% of admissions, 13% of deaths; structured rehab reduces mortality/readmissions.
- Core interventions: 12-week structured outpatient rehab; community secondary prevention via CHV linkage; cardiac rehab units at Level 5–6; tele-rehab support for counties without specialists.
- Levels: Level 3 (risk screening/education), Level 4–5 (outpatient rehab start), Level 6 (complex rehab/oversight).
- Timeline: Pilot 10 high-burden counties (0–12 months); scale to all Level 5–6 (12–36 months); community roll-out (36–60 months).
- Resource estimate: KES ~4–5B over 3 years (national scale) — training of physiotherapists, exercise equipment, program costs.
- Key KPI: % of eligible post-MI patients completing rehab; 1-year readmission rate.

2) Cancer early detection & referral
- Why: Cancer is 2nd leading cause of death; late presentation dominates poor outcomes.
- Core interventions: strengthen early detection (breast, cervical, prostate), diagnostic hubs at Level 4–5, standardized referral pathways to Level 6, NHIF inclusion for diagnostics and chemo, cancer registry strengthening.
- Levels: Level 2–3 (screening), Level 4 (diagnostics/biopsy), Level 6 (treatment).
- Timeline: Strengthen screening and referral guidelines (0–6 months); equip 15 county diagnostic hubs (6–24 months); scale diagnostics network (24–48 months).
- Resource estimate: Medium-high; incremental investments in pathology, imaging, and oncology drugs. Seek blended financing (NHIF + donors + counties).
- KPI: Stage at diagnosis distribution; time from suspicion to definitive diagnosis.

3) Pneumonia prevention and acute care
- Why: Leading registered cause of death, especially affecting under-fives and elderly.
- Core interventions: strengthen community case management (CHVs), expanded pneumococcal & influenza vaccine coverage, oxygen systems at Level 2–4, IMCI refresher training, pulse oximetry at all facilities.
- Levels: Level 1–3 (prevention, early referral), Level 4 (oxygen therapy), Level 5–6 (critical care).
- Timeline: CHV and IMCI scale-up + oxygen procurement (0–18 months).
- Resource estimate: Moderate; oxygen concentrators, pulse oximeters, training; potential donor support for equipment.
- KPI: Under-5 pneumonia mortality; oxygen availability at facilities.

4) Emergency obstetric & newborn care (EmONC)
- Why: MMR 130–170/100,000 with county disparities; referral & blood/CS capacity gaps.
- Core interventions: Ensure all Level 4s provide basic EmONC and Level 5 provide comprehensive EmONC; blood transfusion services at county referral hospitals; obstetric theatre capacity; ambulance referral coordination.
- Levels: Level 3 (antenatal detection/referral), Level 4 (basic EmONC), Level 5 (comprehensive EmONC).
- Timeline: Equip and certify all Level 4–5 facilities over 12–36 months; strengthen referral systems immediately.
- Resource estimate: Medium-high depending on gaps in theatre/blood services.
- KPI: Facility-based maternal mortality ratio; % births in EmONC-capable facility.

5) Mental health integration
- Why: Rising burden, severe service gaps; high disability & co-morbidity with NCDs.
- Core interventions: integrate mhGAP into primary care (Level 2–3), establish county-level psychiatric units at Level 5, community follow-up via CHVs, psychotropic drug supply chain.
- Levels: Level 2–3 (screening/first-line care), Level 5 (specialist support), Level 6 (complex cases).
- Timeline: mhGAP rollout + training (0–12 months); establish county focal points (12–36 months).
- Resource estimate: Relatively low capital cost; investment in training, supervision, medicines.
- KPI: % of primary health facilities offering basic mental health services; treatment initiation rates.

6) Trauma and injury care (working age 15–49; injuries leading cause 15–29)
- Why: Major cause of death in young adults; high productivity loss.
- Core interventions: Basic trauma care at Level 3–4, surgical capacity at Level 5, prehospital care protocols and ambulance network strengthening, essential orthopaedic services.
- Levels: Level 3 (stabilisation), Level 4–5 (definitive surgical care).
- Timeline: Develop and implement county trauma plans (0–12 months); strengthen Level 4–5 surgical capacity (12–36 months).
- Resource estimate: Medium — theatre upgrades, training in emergency, orthopaedic supplies.
- KPI: Time-to-definitive-care; trauma case fatality rate.

Cross-cutting system enablers (must accompany all packages)
1. Workforce: scale training (nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, clinical officers), task-sharing, and incentive packages for rural retention. Fast-track certification programs and continuing professional development at county training centres.
2. Financing: expand NHIF benefit package to cover essential diagnostics, rehab, oncology basics, EmONC costs; design county co-financing arrangements and performance-based financing for results.
3. Referral network & transport: standardized referral forms, teleconsultation links between Level 3/4 and Level 5/6, county-coordinated ambulances and community referral funds (with CHV referral triggers).
4. Supplies & oxygen: national procurement pooled for essential diagnostics, chemo agents, oxygen concentrators, blood bank strengthening; maintain buffer stock lists in KHIS.
5. Digital health & data: use DHIS2/KHIS to track KPIs, roll out telemedicine for specialist support, integrate cancer registry and rehabilitation registries.

Implementation phasing (practical roadmap)
- Phase 0 (0–3 months): National technical guidance documents, priority county selection (10 high-burden counties), immediate procurement of oxygen/pulse oximeters, fast-track NHIF benefit updates.
- Phase 1 (3–12 months): Pilot packages in selected counties — training, referral pathway tests, service-level SOPs, baseline indicators.
- Phase 2 (12–36 months): Scale to all Level 4–6 facilities; resource mobilisation for capital works; county capacity building.
- Phase 3 (36–60 months): Consolidation, community integration, sustainability measures (county budget line items, workforce pipelines).

Governance & financing model
- National MOH: technical standards, commodity procurement, specialized services (Level 6), NHIF package design.
- County governments: service delivery, staffing, facility upgrades, ambulances.
- NHIF: revision of essential packages with explicit coverage for rehab, diagnostics, EmONC, essential cancer services.
- Partners/donors: targeted capital (e.g., pathology labs, oxygen hubs) and implementation support.
- Public-private partnerships to close specialist gaps in the near term (tele-oncology, visiting specialists).

Monitoring & evaluation (core indicators)
- Service availability: % facilities by level offering each priority service.
- Coverage & quality: % eligible patients receiving care (e.g., % post-MI in rehab); time-to-diagnosis for cancer.
- Impact: disease-specific mortality trends (pneumonia under-5, CVD mortality), MMR, trauma CFR.
- Equity: rural vs urban service coverage; county-level performance.

Immediate “first 90 days” actions I recommend to the cabinet secretary / county executives
1. Approve a national “High-Burden Services Fast-Track” directive (CVD rehab, cancer detection, pneumonia, EmONC, mental health, trauma).
2. Select 10 pilot counties (mix of urban high-burden and underserved rural) and allocate seed financing.
3. Mandate NHIF to update benefit package for pilot interventions and fast-track reimbursement rates.
4. Procure oxygen concentrators, pulse oximeters, and basic rehab equipment for pilot counties.
5. Deploy national technical teams to co-design county implementation plans and an M&E dashboard.

Offer
