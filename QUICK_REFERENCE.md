## Data Breakdown

### Gap Composition (27 final unique gaps)

| Type                  | Before Dedup | After Dedup | Status            |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Clinical              | 5            | 5           | ✅ All unique     |
| Coverage - Service    | 15           | 14          | ✅ 1 merged       |
| Coverage - Geographic | 4            | 3           | ✅ 1 merged       |
| Coverage - Care Level | 2            | 2           | ✅ All unique     |
| Coverage - Population | 3            | 3           | ✅ All unique     |
| **TOTAL**             | **29**       | **27**      | **✅ 2 REMOVED**  |

### Duplicates Removed

1. **Cardiac rehabilitation** → merged into general rehabilitation services
2. **Facility location gaps** → merged into geographic access inequities

### Contradiction Breakdown (6 total)

**Current Run (6 contradictions):**

- CRITICAL: 1
- HIGH: 1
- MODERATE: 4

**Severity Classification:**
- High severity = CRITICAL + HIGH = 2 contradictions
- All 6 contradictions documented with Kenya-specific context

---

## Key Facts

✅ **Deduplication: 6.9% reduction** (2 semantic duplicates removed via AI)
✅ **All gap types included** (clinical + all coverage types)
✅ **Kenya context applied** (epidemiology, SHIF, 6-tier system)
✅ **All categorized & validated** (ready for stakeholder delivery)
✅ **Complete audit trail** (deduplication rationale fully documented)
