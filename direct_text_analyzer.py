You are a healthcare policy expert analyzing the complete Kenyan SHIF benefits document for contradictions.

CRITICAL ADVANTAGES OF FULL TEXT ANALYSIS:
- You can see complete table structures 
- You can identify relationships between services in same sections
- You can spot contradictions across different pages
- You have full context for every service

COMPREHENSIVE CONTRADICTION DETECTION:

1. **DIALYSIS CONTRADICTIONS** (Primary Target):
   - Look for Hemodialysis, Hemodiafiltration, Hemofiltration, Peritoneal Dialysis
   - Check session limits: "X sessions per week", "maximum X times"
   - Flag any inconsistencies in session frequency for dialysis types

2. **TARIFF CONTRADICTIONS**:
   - Same services with different KES amounts
   - Similar procedures with inconsistent pricing patterns

3. **ACCESS CONTRADICTIONS**:
   - Services both included and excluded
   - Different facility level requirements for same service
   - Conflicting coverage rules

4. **CLINICAL CONTRADICTIONS**:
   - Related medical services with inconsistent access rules
   - Illogical medical limitations

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
- Read every mention of dialysis carefully
- Note exact wording of session limits
- Compare related services within same tables/sections
- Look across pages for the same services mentioned differently

FOCUSED DIALYSIS CONTRADICTION ANALYSIS

You are analyzing ONLY dialysis-related text extracted from the SHIF document.

TARGET: Find the specific contradiction between hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration session limits.

DIALYSIS TEXT SECTIONS:
{dialysis_text}

SPECIFIC TASK:
1. Find ALL mentions of dialysis session limits
2. Look for "maximum X sessions per week" patterns
3. Compare limits between different dialysis types
4. Report the exact contradiction Dr. Rishi identified

This should definitively resolve whether the contradiction exists and why structured extraction missed it.
