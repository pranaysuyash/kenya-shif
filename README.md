# Kenya SHIF Healthcare Policy Analyzer

## System Overview

This system analyzes the Kenya Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) benefit package document to extract healthcare services, detect contradictions, identify coverage gaps, and provide AI-enhanced insights.

## Key Components

1. **Integrated Comprehensive Medical Analyzer** - Main extraction and analysis engine
2. **SHIF Healthcare Pattern Analyzer** - Non-AI fallback analysis
3. **Streamlit Dashboard** - Interactive visualization interface
4. **Deterministic Checker** - Validation without AI dependencies

## Data Flow & Storage

### Fresh Extraction Output

When you run a fresh analysis:

1. PDF is extracted and analyzed
2. All results are saved to a timestamped folder: `outputs_run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
3. Contains: `rules_p1_18_structured.csv`, `annex_procedures.csv`, `ai_contradictions.csv`, `ai_gaps.csv`, etc.

### Data Loading Priority

In `load_existing_results()`:

```text
PRIORITY 1: Fresh CSV Data from Latest Run
- Searches for most recent outputs_run_*/ folder
- Loads: rules_p1_18_structured.csv (policy services)
- Loads: annex_procedures.csv (annex procedures)
- Sets source_type = 'fresh_extraction_csv'
- Syncs to session state for persistence

PRIORITY 2: Historical JSON Archive (Fallback)
- Only if no fresh run found
- Loads from: outputs_generalized/generalized_complete_analysis.json
- Sets source_type = 'historical_archive'
```

### Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: First Run

- Click "Run Fresh Analysis" → PDF extracted → `outputs_run_20251017_112838/`
- Analysis completes → 97 policy + 728 annex = 825 services
- Results displayed in tabs → Session state persists data

#### Scenario 2: Load Previous Results

- Click "Load Existing Results"
- System checks latest `outputs_run_*/` folder
- Loads fresh CSVs if found (825 services)
- Falls back to historical JSON if no fresh run (629 services from old extraction)
- Data persists in session across tab switches

#### Scenario 3: Multiple Runs

- First run → `outputs_run_20251017_112838/` → 825 services loaded
- Switch tabs → Data persists via `st.session_state`
- Run fresh analysis again → `outputs_run_20251017_120000/` (new folder)
- Click Load Existing → Loads from new folder automatically

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Java (for tabula PDF extraction)
- Virtual environment with required packages
- OpenAI API key (for AI analysis)

## Quick Start

1. Ensure the PDF is named: `TARIFFS TO THE BENEFIT PACKAGE TO THE SHI.pdf`
2. Activate virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Run analysis: `python run_analyzer.py`
4. View dashboard: `streamlit run streamlit_comprehensive_analyzer.py`

## Output Files

All fresh results are saved in timestamped folders `outputs_run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`:

- `rules_p1_18_structured.csv` - 97 policy services
- `annex_procedures.csv` - 728 annex procedures
- `ai_contradictions.csv` - Detected policy contradictions
- `ai_gaps.csv` - Identified coverage gaps
- `integrated_comprehensive_analysis.json` - Complete analysis
- `analysis_summary.csv` - Summary metrics

Historical data is stored in `outputs_generalized/` for fallback access.

## Accessing Results

- **Streamlit Dashboard**: http://localhost:8501
- **Fresh CSV Data**: `outputs_run_*/` folders (latest = most recent run)
- **Direct CSV Access**: `rules_p1_18_structured.csv`, `annex_procedures.csv`
- **Complete JSON**: `outputs_run_*/integrated_comprehensive_analysis.json`
- **Deterministic Validation**: `python deterministic_checker.py` (shows current counts)

## 🎯 Current Status - October 17, 2025

### ✅ System Fully Operational

**Latest Results:**
- **Total Services**: 825 (97 policy + 728 annex)
- **Contradictions**: 6 detected with proper severity classification (5 high severity)
- **Coverage Gaps**: 27 final gaps after AI-powered deduplication
  - 29 total gaps initially identified (5 clinical + 24 coverage)
  - 2 duplicates removed through OpenAI semantic analysis
  - **27 final deduplicated gaps** delivered in outputs
- **Tariff Coverage**: 98.8% of services analyzed
- **Dashboard Metrics**: All showing correct numbers from CSV data

### ✅ Recent Fixes & Improvements

1. **Dashboard Metrics Fixed**
   - Fixed field mapping issues (`impact` → `coverage_priority`, `severity` → `clinical_severity`)
   - All metrics now display accurate counts from CSV files

2. **JSON-to-Table Formatting**
   - Added automatic JSON field formatting for better readability
   - `kenya_context`, `coverage_analysis`, `interventions` now display as tables
   - Improved user experience for viewing complex AI analysis

3. **Field Mapping Corrections**
   - Updated CSV column mappings to match actual data structure
   - Proper handling of `coverage_priority` for impact assessment
   - Correct `clinical_severity` field usage for contradiction severity

### ✅ Key Features Working

- **PDF Extraction**: 98.8% success rate, handles complex formatting
- **AI Analysis**: OpenAI-powered contradiction and gap detection with deterministic settings
- **Deduplication**: Fast heuristic deduplication (reduces 29→27 gaps intelligently)
  - Cardiac Rehabilitation: **KEPT SEPARATE** from general rehabilitation (different specialties - cardiology vs PT/OT)
  - General Rehabilitation: **KEPT SEPARATE** from cardiac rehabilitation (requires different expertise)
  - Geographic Access Gaps: **MERGED** (COVERAGE_GEOGRAPHIC_ACCESS_01 + _04 both describe spatial access barriers)
- **Comprehensive Output**: 30+ CSV files with detailed analysis
- **Streamlit Interface**: Professional multi-tab dashboard
- **Data Persistence**: Session state maintains results across navigation

4. **Analysis**:
   - Contradictions detected by comparing rules (facility, tariff, coverage).
   - Gaps identified by matching against Kenya health context and epidemiology.
   - AI-enhanced analysis uses OpenAI (deterministic: temperature=0, seed=42).
5. **Results Saving**: All outputs saved in timestamped folders (`outputs_run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`).
6. **Visualization**: Streamlit app displays metrics, charts, tables, and summaries.
7. **Download/Export**: User can download any result (CSV, JSON, ZIP) or save locally.
8. **Historical Access**: User can browse previous runs, load any folder, or restore from ZIP.
