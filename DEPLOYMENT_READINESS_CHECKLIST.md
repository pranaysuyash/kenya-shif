## Pre-Deployment Actions (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Add & Commit All Changes

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Final deployment prep: Add documentation viewer and system documentation"
```

### Step 2: Verify Remote Status

```bash
git remote -v  # Should show pranaysuyash/kenya-shif
git push origin main  # Push to GitHub
```

### Step 3: Set Up Streamlit Cloud Secrets

1. Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Log in with GitHub account
3. Add new app: Connect to `pranaysuyash/kenya-shif` repo
4. Set environment variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - `DEPLOYMENT_ENV`: `streamlit_cloud` (optional, for detection)

---

## Deployment Steps (On Streamlit Cloud)

1. **Connect Repository**

   - Link GitHub account
   - Select `kenya-shif` repository
   - Select `main` branch

2. **Configure Settings**

   - Main file: `streamlit_comprehensive_analyzer.py`
   - Python version: 3.9+ (Streamlit Cloud default)

3. **Add Secrets**

   - Click "⚙️ Settings" → "Secrets"
   - Paste your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
     ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 2-5 minutes for build and deployment
   - Access at: `https://share.streamlit.io/pranaysuyash/kenya-shif/main/streamlit_comprehensive_analyzer.py`

## Expected Behavior on Streamlit Cloud

### ✅ Works As Expected

- Dashboard loads and displays all tabs
- PDF extraction runs (with live progress)
- AI analysis works (if OpenAI key is set)
- Download buttons generate CSV/JSON/ZIP files
- Historical tab shows empty (first run) - users download and re-upload to restore

### ⚠️ Cloud Limitations (Expected)

- **Storage**: Ephemeral (session-only)
  - Solution: Users download results immediately
  - Historical restore: Upload previous ZIP files
- **File Persistence**: Output folders deleted after session ends
  - Solution: Download feature provides all results
- **No Direct File Browse**: Works with custom path input
  - Solution: Users upload to restore previous runs

### ⏱️ Performance Notes

- First run: 5-10 minutes (PDF extraction + AI analysis)
- Subsequent runs: 2-3 minutes (cached vocabulary, etc.)
- Download: 2-5 seconds (depends on file size)

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### First Test After Deployment

1. Open Streamlit Cloud app URL
2. Verify sidebar loads (docs viewer accessible)
3. Click "Run Complete Extraction" button
4. Verify progress indicators and extraction logs appear
5. Download results from Downloads tab
6. Verify CSV/ZIP files are valid
7. Test Historical tab (should be empty on first run)

### User Flow Test

1. Load app
2. Run extraction (or load existing results)
3. View analysis in all 6 tabs
4. Download results
5. Access documentation from sidebar
6. Verify no errors in Streamlit Cloud logs

---

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Arise)

1. **Pause Deployment**: Go to Streamlit Cloud app settings
2. **Fix Locally**: Make changes to main branch
3. **Push Fixes**: `git push origin main`
4. **Streamlit Cloud** auto-rebuilds (or manually trigger)
5. **Test Again**: Verify fixes work

---

## Success Criteria for Deployment
