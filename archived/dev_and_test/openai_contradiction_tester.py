RENAL CARE PACKAGE

The following services are covered under the renal care package:

1. Haemodialysis
   - Covered for chronic kidney disease patients
   - Maximum of 3 sessions per week
   - Available at Level 4, 5, and 6 facilities

2. Hemodiafiltration  
   - Advanced dialysis treatment
   - Maximum of 2 sessions per week
   - Available at Level 5 and 6 facilities

3. Peritoneal Dialysis
   - Home-based dialysis option
   - Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis
   - Available at Level 4, 5, and 6 facilities

You are analyzing healthcare policy text for contradictions.

MEDICAL CONTEXT:
- Haemodialysis and Hemodiafiltration are both types of dialysis treatment
- Both treat the same condition (kidney failure) 
- Patients typically need consistent dialysis frequency for medical stability
- Different session limits for similar treatments may indicate policy errors

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
{dialysis_text}

TASK: Look for contradictions in treatment access rules, particularly:
1. Different session limits for similar medical procedures
2. Inconsistent facility level requirements
3. Coverage conflicts

RESPONSE FORMAT:
{{
  "contradictions_found": [
    {{
      "type": "Session_Limit_Conflict",
      "service_1": "service name",
