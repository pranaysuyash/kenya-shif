## 🎯 CRITICAL FINDINGS VALIDATED

### **Disease-Treatment Gaps (Assignment Example Found)**
Exactly as requested: "diseases like hypertension with no corresponding treatment coverage"

| Disease | Mentions | Treatment Coverage | Status |
|---------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Hypertension** | 7 times | 0 medications | 🔴 CRITICAL GAP |
| **Diabetes** | 5 times | 0 medications | 🔴 CRITICAL GAP |
| **Asthma** | 5 times | 0 medications | 🔴 CRITICAL GAP |

### **Contradictions (Assignment Example Confirmed)**  
Supporting research confirms **dialysis coverage crisis**:
- **Policy Promise:** KES 10,650 per session
- **Reality:** Reduced to KES 2,375 (75% cut)
- **Impact:** Patients forced to pay KES 7,000 cash
