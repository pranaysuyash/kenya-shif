# 🎯 TASK 2: CONTRADICTION DETECTION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## ✅ COMPLETION STATUS: FULLY COMPLETED

### 📊 KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

**Task 2 Requirement**: *"Detect contradictions (e.g., 'Dialysis covered 2x/week' vs. 'Dialysis excluded in Level 5')"*

✅ **DELIVERED**: Enhanced AI-powered contradiction detection system with comprehensive analysis

---

## 🔍 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Multi-Layered Detection Approach
1. **Facility-Level Conflict Detection**
   - Identifies services covered in one facility level but excluded in another
   - Example: Service X available in Level 3 vs Service X excluded from Level 3

2. **Service Limit Contradiction Analysis** 
   - Detects conflicting frequency/quantity limits
   - Example: Dialysis 2x/week vs Dialysis 3x/week

3. **Tariff Inconsistency Detection**
   - Finds identical services with different costs
   - Cross-facility and within-facility analysis

4. **Coverage vs Exclusion Analysis**
   - Identifies services both included and explicitly excluded
   - Policy coherence validation

5. **AI-Powered Semantic Analysis**
   - OpenAI integration for subtle contradiction detection
   - Natural language processing of policy text
