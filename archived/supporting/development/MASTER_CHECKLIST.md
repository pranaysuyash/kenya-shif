## Communication Options

### Email Submission
```
To: Dr. Rishi
Subject: SHIF Analysis Complete - Contradiction Candidates Flagged with Evidence
Attachments: Excel dashboard, documentation
Tone: Professional, evidence-focused
```

### WhatsApp Message
```
Hi Dr. Rishi, SHIF analysis complete âœ“
â€¢ Dialysis discrepancy flagged (Pages 23 vs 41)
â€¢ Stroke gap identified as requested
â€¢ ~12 potential contradictions with evidence
â€¢ Excel dashboard sent via email
Ready to discuss findings or demonstrate tool.
```

### Phone Call Points
1. Assignment complete with evidence tracking
2. Dialysis contradiction confirmed as hypothesized
3. Stroke gap identified per request
4. Excel dashboard with validation fields
5. 30-second analysis vs 5-day manual review

## Validation Language

### What to Say
- "Flagged potential contradictions"
- "Candidates for review"
- "Evidence suggests"
- "Pending validation"
- "Illustrative savings scenarios"

### What NOT to Say
- ~~"Confirmed contradictions"~~
- ~~"Definite savings of KES 45M"~~
- ~~"Guaranteed results"~~
- ~~"Proven findings"~~
- ~~"Automated decision-making"~~

## Demo Preparation

### If Asked for Demo
1. Show Excel dashboard first (business focus)
2. Highlight dialysis finding with evidence
3. Show stroke gap identification
4. Explain 4 contradiction types
5. Walk through one validation example

### Technical Questions Ready
- Fuzzy matching at 80% threshold
- 4 contradiction categories defined
- Evidence chain implementation
- Confidence scoring system
- Page-level tracking method

## Risk Mitigation

### If Challenged on Findings
- Emphasize "flagged for review" not confirmed
- Show evidence tracking (pages + snippets)
- Explain validation process
- Highlight confidence scores
- Offer to validate together

### If Asked About Accuracy
- This is a prototype for demonstration
- All findings require human validation
- Evidence provided for verification
- Confidence scores guide prioritization
- Production version would add ML validation

## Success Metrics

### Assignment Requirements
âœ… Extract rules from SHIF PDF  
âœ… Detect contradictions (dialysis found)
âœ… Identify gaps (stroke found)
âœ… Create simple dashboard (Excel)
âœ… Show product thinking

### Added Value
âœ… Evidence tracking for validation
âœ… Confidence scoring system
âœ… Business impact scenarios
âœ… Complete documentation
âœ… 30-second performance
