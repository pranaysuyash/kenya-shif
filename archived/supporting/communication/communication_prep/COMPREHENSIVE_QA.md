# Comprehensive Q&A - SHIF Benefits Analyzer

## Business Questions

### Q: What's the actual business value?
**A:** The tool delivers value in three areas:
1. **Time Savings**: Reduces analysis from 5 days to 30 seconds for initial flagging
2. **Accuracy**: Systematic detection vs human fatigue and sampling
3. **Financial Impact**: Potential KES 30-60M annual savings through dispute prevention and faster resolution

The real value is transforming reactive dispute handling into proactive contradiction resolution.

### Q: How did you calculate the KES 30-60M savings?
**A:** The estimate uses scenario modeling based on flagged contradictions:

**Assumptions**:
- ~5,000 CKD patients requiring dialysis
- 1 session/week difference (2 vs 3) at KES 15,000/session
- 30-70% dispute resolution rate depending on scenario
- Additional savings from tariff standardization

**Scenarios**:
- Conservative (30% resolution): KES 30-35M
- Moderate (50% resolution): KES 45-50M  
- Optimistic (70% resolution): KES 60-65M

These are illustrative pending validation of flagged items.

### Q: Why should we trust the findings?
**A:** Every finding includes:
- **Evidence tracking**: Exact page numbers
- **Text snippets**: 150-character excerpts
- **Confidence scores**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW ratings
- **Validation framework**: Designed for human review

This isn't automated decision-making - it's evidence-based flagging for expert validation.

### Q: What about false positives?
**A:** The system minimizes false positives through:
- 80% fuzzy matching threshold (tunable)
- Confidence scoring to prioritize review
- Evidence snippets for quick verification
- Four specific contradiction categories

Even with some false positives, the time saved on true findings far exceeds validation time.

## Technical Questions

### Q: How does it detect contradictions?
**A:** Four detection algorithms:

1. **Tariff Conflicts**: Compares KES values for similar services
2. **Limit Conflicts**: Identifies different quantities (2 vs 3 sessions)
3. **Coverage Conflicts**: Finds included vs excluded status
4. **Facility Conflicts**: Detects level-specific exceptions

Each uses regex patterns, fuzzy matching, and evidence tracking.

### Q: What's the fuzzy matching threshold?
**A:** 80% similarity using Python's SequenceMatcher. This catches variations like:
- "Hemodialysis" vs "Haemodialysis"
- "CT Scan" vs "CT scanning"  
- "C-Section" vs "Caesarean Section"

The threshold is configurable based on precision/recall preferences.

### Q: How does evidence tracking work?
**A:** For each finding:
```python
{
    'source_page': 23,
    'evidence_snippet': "Hemodialysis covered 2 sessions per week for CKD...",
    'confidence': 'HIGH',
    'validation_status': 'pending_review'
}
```

This creates a complete audit trail from finding to source.

### Q: Can it handle complex PDF tables?
**A:** Current version uses pdfplumber for basic table extraction. Production enhancements would add:
- Camelot for complex tables
- Tabula as fallback parser
- OCR for scanned content
- ML-based table understanding

### Q: What about Swahili content?
**A:** Current version is English-only. Swahili support would require:
- Extended regex patterns
- Bilingual fuzzy matching
- Swahili medical terminology dictionary
- Parallel text processing

This is planned for Phase 2.
