## A. TOP RISKS

### **1. BLOCKER: Complete Unit Extraction Failure**
**Impact**: Critical tariff contradictions undetectable due to 100% "unspecified" unit extraction  
**Evidence**: All 57 rules in verification_results/rules.csv show tariff_unit="unspecified"  
**Fix**: Expand extract_tariff_and_unit() patterns to include implicit units ("consultation" → "per_consultation") and category-based inference

### **2. BLOCKER: Over-Aggressive Service Normalization** 
**Impact**: False positive grouping of unrelated services  
**Evidence**: Service key "level" groups facility levels with service pricing in contradictions.csv  
**Fix**: Preserve semantic context in normalize_service_key() and add category prefixes to prevent cross-domain collisions

### **3. MAJOR: Detection Rate Too Low (1.75%)**
**Impact**: Tool appears less useful than manual review  
**Evidence**: 1 contradiction found in 57 rules vs expected healthcare baseline of 5-10%  
**Fix**: Investigate if legitimate conflicts are missed due to normalization/unit extraction issues

### **4. MAJOR: Missing Expected Contradiction Types**
**Impact**: Core healthcare scenarios not detected  
**Evidence**: Only Tariff type found, no Limit/Coverage/Facility-exclusion despite dialysis service present  
**Fix**: Debug why dialysis service with {per_week: 3} doesn't generate limit conflicts

### **5. MINOR: Evidence Snippets Too Short for Healthcare Context**  
**Impact**: Insufficient context for clinical validation  
**Evidence**: 100-character snippets inadequate for complex medical rules  
**Fix**: Increase snippet length to 200+ characters for proper medical context

---

## B. CODE FINDINGS

### **shif_analyzer.py - Core Implementation**

#### **extract_tariff_and_unit() (Lines 169-201)**
- **Issue**: Patterns miss healthcare terminology ("per consultation", "per procedure")
- **Issue**: No fallback unit inference based on service category
- **Issue**: Range pricing "KES 3,000-5,000" not handled
- **Fix**: Add medical service implicit unit patterns and category-based inference

#### **normalize_service_key() (Lines 203-212)**  
- **Issue**: Over-normalization loses medical context ("MRI head" vs "MRI spine")
- **Issue**: No category preservation allows cross-domain false matches
- **Fix**: Preserve key medical terms and add category prefixes

#### **find_tariff_conflicts() (Lines 534-548)**
- **Issue**: 10% variance threshold too low for healthcare pricing variations
- **Issue**: Single-price comparison unreliable without statistical significance
- **Fix**: Increase threshold to 20% and require multiple price points for confidence

#### **parse_pdf_with_pdfplumber() (Lines 322-400)**
- **Issue**: No fallback when table extraction fails
- **Issue**: Single extraction method creates brittleness  
- **Fix**: Add Camelot/Tabula as backup extractors with OCR fallback

### **expectations.yaml - Configuration**
- **Good**: Proper YAML structure with expected services per condition
- **Issue**: "hemodialysis" vs "haemodialysis" spelling variations not normalized
- **Fix**: Add medical terminology variants to expected service lists

### **Test Files Analysis**
- **test_fixed_analyzer.py**: Comprehensive but SSL warning in download_pdf()
- **critical_test.py**: Basic functionality only, missing edge cases
- **Issue**: No unit tests for medical term normalization
- **Fix**: Add healthcare-specific edge case tests

---

## C. LOGIC/ALGORITHM ISSUES

### **Edge Cases Missed**:

1. **Multi-Service Lines**: "Consultation KES 500, follow-up KES 200 per visit"
   - Current: Takes first amount only
   - Check: Parse all monetary amounts with position-based unit binding

2. **Medical Term Variants**: "Hemodialysis", "Haemodialysis", "HD", "Renal replacement"  
   - Current: May not group properly
   - Check: Implement medical terminology normalization dictionary

3. **Implicit Facility References**: "Primary care facilities" vs "Level 1-2"
   - Current: Only matches explicit "Level X" patterns
   - Check: Add healthcare facility taxonomy mapping

4. **Household vs Beneficiary Caps**: "Per household per year" vs "per beneficiary annually"
   - Current: May conflate different limit types
   - Check: Separate limit categorization logic

### **Specific Algorithm Checks Needed**:
- Verify unit extraction doesn't cross-match "per session" with "per day"  
- Confirm service grouping doesn't match "MRI head" with "CT head"
- Validate facility-exclusion only flags same-level conflicts
- Test limit comparison handles numeric edge cases (0, null, string values)

## D. EVIDENCE & OUTPUTS ASSESSMENT

### **CSV Column Compliance** ⚠️ PARTIAL:

**rules.csv** (57 rules):
- ✅ Has: service, service_key, tariff, tariff_unit, facility_levels, coverage_status, limits, page, raw_text
- ❌ Missing: All tariff_unit values are "unspecified" (extraction failure)
- ❌ Issue: facility_levels stored as string "[4,5,6]" not proper JSON

**contradictions.csv** (1 contradiction):
- ✅ Has: service, type, unit, details, left_page, left_snippet, right_page, right_snippet, severity, confidence
- ✅ Evidence verified: Page 6 snippets confirmed present in PDF
- ❌ Issue: Generic service key "level" masks actual service being compared

**gaps.csv** (3 gaps):
- ✅ YAML-driven detection working correctly
- ✅ "Stroke rehabilitation" properly flagged as NO COVERAGE FOUND
- ✅ Expected services list populated from YAML

### **Page Reference Validation** ✅:
**Manual PDF Check**:
- Page 6: "➢ Level 4 – KES 3,500" → CONFIRMED PRESENT
- Page 6: "Level 4-6 ➢ Level 6 – KES 5,000" → CONFIRMED PRESENT  
- Evidence traceability system working properly

### **Excel Dashboard** ⚠️:
- ✅ Multiple sheets present (Rules, Contradictions, Gaps, Summary)
- ✅ Uses "flagged for validation" language
- ❌ Missing: Detailed methodology sheet with worked examples
- ❌ Missing: No hardcoded savings (good) but no impact framework either

---

## E. PRODUCT/DOCUMENTATION FEEDBACK

### **Claims Assessment**:

**README.md**:
- ❌ **Overstated**: "Evidence-based analyzer" when unit extraction fails 100%
- ❌ **Misleading**: Claims "4 validated categories" but only 1 type found
- ✅ **Good**: Conservative language about validation requirements

**EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md vs EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_UPDATED.md**:
- ✅ **Improved**: Updated version removes unvalidated savings claims
- ✅ **Good**: Focuses on process improvement vs financial promises
- ❌ **Missing**: No discussion of current limitations (unit extraction failure)

**Communication Prep Files**:
- ✅ **UPDATED_QA_RESPONSES.md**: Properly conservative Q&A responses
- ✅ **Good**: Validation-first approach throughout
- ❌ **Gap**: No discussion of technical limitations for stakeholder preparation

### **Required Methods & Assumptions for Excel Summary**:
```
DETECTION METHODOLOGY (6-8 bullets):
• Service Extraction: pdfplumber with table + text fallback
• Unit Binding: Nearest-neighbor distance for tariff-unit association
• Service Grouping: Normalized key matching with fuzzy similarity
• Contradiction Types: 4 classes (Tariff, Limit, Coverage, Facility-exclusion)
• Evidence Tracking: Page references + 150-char text snippets
• Gap Detection: YAML-driven expected service mapping
• Confidence Scoring: Based on text similarity and evidence quality
• Validation Required: All findings are candidates needing expert review

CURRENT LIMITATIONS:
• Unit extraction: 100% failure rate on current PDF patterns
• Service normalization: May over-group unrelated medical services  
• Pattern coverage: Limited to explicit exclusion language
• Single extraction method: No OCR or advanced table parsing fallback

WORKED EXAMPLE - Level Pricing Variance:
Input: Page 6 contains "Level 4 – KES 3,500" and "Level 6 – KES 5,000"
Detection: Tariff conflict flagged due to price variance in same service category
Evidence: Both snippets traceable to page 6 with exact text matches
Next Step: Clinical reviewer validates if pricing tiers represent legitimate structure vs policy inconsistency
```

## F. QUICK WINS (≤2 Hours) & NEXT SPRINT

### **Quick Wins** (Total: 4 hours):

1. **Expand evidence snippets** (15 minutes):
   - Change snippet length from 100 to 200 characters
   - Add surrounding context preservation

2. **Add unit extraction patterns** (90 minutes):
   - Include "per consultation", "per procedure", "per scan" patterns
   - Add category-based unit inference for common services

3. **Fix JSON serialization** (30 minutes):  
   - Store facility_levels as proper JSON array not string representation
   - Ensure consistent data types across CSV columns

4. **Add service category prefixes** (45 minutes):
   - Prevent cross-category false matches by prefixing normalized keys
   - Example: "imaging_mri_head" vs "consultation_head_examination"
