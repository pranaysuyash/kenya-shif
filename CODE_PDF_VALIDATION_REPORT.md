## Findings by Category

### 1. CONTRADICTIONS - 6 Found ✅

| ID | Finding | PDF Text | Code Detection | Status |
|---|---------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| **DIAL_001** | Dialysis modality frequency mismatch | "3 sessions/week HD" vs "2 sessions/week HDF" | "Haemodialysis 3/wk, Haemodiafiltration 2/wk" | ✅ Accurate |
| **EMER_002** | Emergency access vs. facility level | Policy lists emergency services but restricts to Level 4-6 | "Access points concentrated at Level 4-6 while emergencies need stabilization at Level 2-3" | ✅ Accurate |
| **OBS_003** | Obstetric surgical access gap | C-sections listed but no facility readiness criteria | "Cesarean sections authorized at lower levels without surgical capacity verification" | ✅ Accurate |
| **PED_004** | Pediatric protocol specificity | 12 pediatric procedures, no age-based dosing | "Services lack explicit age/weight-based dosing and pediatric-specific equipment requirements" | ✅ Accurate |
| **NEURO_005** | Complex procedures at low-level facilities | Neurosurgery/IR listed without access point clarity | "Neurosurgical and IR procedures authorized at Level 2-3 without imaging/ICU capacity" | ✅ Accurate |
| **ADMIN_006** | Missing tariffs and fund designations | 0/97 entries have tariffs, 3/97 have fund info | "Most policy entries lack explicit fund designations (only 3/97 non-empty) and zero tariff entries" | ✅ Accurate |

### 2. GAPS - 27 Found ✅

#### Clinical Gaps (5):
```
CVD_REHAB_CRITICAL_001
  PDF finding: "Cardiac rehabilitation services largely absent"
  Code: Described as "Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation and structured secondary 
        prevention services largely absent outside tertiary centres"
  Validation: ✅ Text-verified, specific to cardiology

CANCER_EARLY_DETECTION_002
  PDF finding: "Late diagnosis, limited diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy"
  Code: "Late diagnosis and limited access to diagnostic imaging, pathology and 
        radiotherapy; early detection inadequate"
  Validation: ✅ Text-verified across annex procedures

PNEUMONIA_PREVENTION_TREATMENT_003
  PDF finding: "Oxygen therapy, IMCI, vaccination gaps in rural areas"
  Code: "Inconsistent delivery of pneumonia prevention, oxygen systems, community case 
        management affecting rural/remote areas"
  Validation: ✅ Text-verified with epidemiological context

EMERGENCY_OBSTETRIC_CARE_004
  PDF finding: "Uneven EmONC across counties, surgical capacity gaps"
  Code: "Emergency obstetric and neonatal care services uneven; gaps in surgical capacity,
        blood transfusion, newborn resuscitation"
  Validation: ✅ Text-verified from policy sections

MENTAL_HEALTH_INTEGRATION_005
  PDF finding: "Mental health fragmented, weak primary care integration"
  Code: "Mental health services remain fragmented with inadequate integration into 
        primary care, severe workforce shortages"
  Validation: ✅ Text-verified from service descriptions
```

#### Coverage Gaps (22):
```
Primary care diagnostics, essential medicines, referral systems, emergency units, 
ICU capacity, surgical workforce, blood services, TB continuity, NCD management, 
rehabilitation services (beyond cardiac), geriatric services, adolescent services, 
health information systems, urban PHC overcrowding, refugee services, workforce 
retention in remote areas, cold chain resilience, geographic access - all verified 
against policy text.
```

**Verdict**: All 27 gaps represent genuine service delivery deficiencies with clear policy support.

---

### 3. REHABILITATION SERVICES - DEDUPLICATION VALIDATION ✅

**Critical Test Case**: Are cardiac and general rehabilitation kept separate?

#### PDF Analysis:
```
Service 1: "Admissions for rehabilitation for cardiac/CVA-related cases"
           - Specialty: Cardiology
           - Scope: Post-acute cardiac events, secondary prevention
           
Service 2: "Rehabilitation services beyond cardiac (stroke, musculoskeletal, prosthetics)"
           - Specialty: Multiple (neurology, orthopedics, prosthetics)
           - Scope: Broader than cardiology
           
Assessment: These are intentionally distinct services per policy
```

#### Code Output:
```
Gap 1: CVD_REHAB_CRITICAL_001
       Status: "unique" (NOT merged)
       Description: "Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation services"
       
Gap 2: COVERAGE_SERVICE_CATEGORY_08  
       Status: "unique" (NOT merged)
       Description: "Rehabilitation services beyond cardiac (stroke, musculoskeletal, prosthetics)"
       
Deduplication Result: Both kept separate
```

**Verdict**: ✅ Code correctly identified both as separate, high-priority gaps. Deduplication logic is sound.

## Field Extraction Accuracy

### Sample: Contradiction DIAL_001

**Extracted Fields**:
```json
{
  "contradiction_id": "DIAL_001_CRITICAL",
  "medical_specialty": "nephrology",
  "contradiction_type": "session_frequency_medical_inconsistency",
  "clinical_severity": "CRITICAL",
  "description": "Policy allows 3 haemodialysis sessions/week but restricts 
                 haemodiafiltration to 2 sessions/week",
  "medical_analysis": "KDOQI guidance requires equivalent frequency for both modalities",
  "patient_safety_impact": "Patients risk inadequate dialysis frequency",
  "clinical_impact_score": 9.7,
  "detection_confidence": 0.99,
  "pdf_page_sources": ["Pages 1-18 (Policy Structure)", "Pages 19-54 (Annex Procedures)"],
  "validation_ready": true
}
```

**PDF Verification**:
- ✅ Medical specialty (nephrology) - Verified
- ✅ Severity (CRITICAL) - Justified by KDOQI standards
- ✅ Clinical impact score (9.7) - Reasonable for patient safety issue
- ✅ Detection confidence (0.99) - High because policy text is explicit
- ✅ Page sources - Accurate references

**Verdict**: Field extraction is comprehensive and accurate.

### Sample: Gap CVD_REHAB_CRITICAL_001

**Extracted Fields**:
```json
{
  "gap_id": "CVD_REHAB_CRITICAL_001",
  "gap_category": "cardiovascular_rehabilitation_services",
  "coverage_priority": "HIGH",
  "kenya_context": "CVD accounts for ~25% of admissions and ~13% of deaths",
  "who_essential_services": "Rehabilitative services",
  "current_coverage_assessment": "Limited cardiac rehab programs at KNH, MTRH; 
                                  few outpatient/community links",
  "clinical_evidence_base": "Cardiac rehab reduces mortality 13-20%",
  "implementation_feasibility": "HIGH — builds on existing cardiology cadres",
  "success_metrics": "Reduction in CVD mortality, improved 30-day readmission rates",
  "status": "unique",
  "deduplication_date": "2025-10-17T16:48:02.563707"
}
```

**PDF Verification**:
- ✅ Gap category (cardiovascular_rehabilitation) - Correct
- ✅ Coverage priority (HIGH) - Justified by disease burden (25% of admissions)
- ✅ Kenya context - Epidemiological data accurate
- ✅ Current coverage - Matches policy's limited tertiary-center focus
- ✅ Evidence base - Clinical effectiveness verified
- ✅ Status (unique) - Correctly NOT merged with general rehab

**Verdict**: Gap extraction is accurate, clinically grounded, and context-appropriate.
