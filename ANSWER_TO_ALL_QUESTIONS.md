## Your Questions & Answers

### Q1: "Maybe the wordings are diff. But actually only 11 of those?"

**A:** The "11" you're seeing is **11 CRITICAL severity contradictions** out of 25 total unique contradictions tracked across all runs.

```
all_unique_contradictions_comprehensive.csv (25 total)
├─ CRITICAL severity: 11 ← This is your "11"
├─ HIGH severity: 10
├─ MODERATE severity: 3
└─ MEDIUM severity: 1
```

This is displayed in the dashboard summary when showing severity distribution.

---

### Q2: "So how still 11? Why could the comprehensive one go missing?"

**A:** The comprehensive file doesn't "go missing" - it's conditionally created:

```python
if hasattr(self, 'unique_tracker') and self.unique_tracker:
    all_unique_gaps = self.unique_tracker.unique_gaps
    if all_unique_gaps:  # Must have data
        # Create all_unique_contradictions_comprehensive.csv
        # Create all_unique_gaps_comprehensive.csv
```

**In October run:** ✅ Both files WERE created

- `all_unique_contradictions_comprehensive.csv`: 25 rows
- `all_unique_gaps_comprehensive.csv`: 144 rows

**Why they'd be missing (older runs):**

- Code didn't have this feature yet
- unique_tracker wasn't initialized
- Scan_output_folders() found no previous runs

---

### Q3: "Why unique tracker may not have data?"

**A:** The unique_tracker ALWAYS has data in recent runs because it:

1. **Initializes:** `UniqueInsightTracker()`
2. **Loads existing:** Checks `persistent_insights.json` (if exists)
3. **Scans folders:** Loops through ALL `outputs_run_*` folders
4. **Accumulates:** Collects unique gaps & contradictions
5. **Prevents duplicates:** Using `is_duplicate_gap()` method

**October run results:**

- Scanned: 33+ previous output folders
- Found: 144 unique gaps across history
- Found: 25 unique contradictions across history
- Result: unique_tracker HAS data ✅

---

### Q4: "Each run extracts data, does patterns and AI analysis right?"

**A:** YES - Each run does:

```
EVERY RUN EXECUTION:
│
├─ EXTRACTION PHASE ✅
│  ├─ Pages 1-18: Extract policy rules → rules_p1_18_structured.csv
│  └─ Pages 19-54: Extract procedures → annex_surgical_tariffs_all.csv
│
├─ PATTERN ANALYSIS ✅ (rule-based, deterministic)
│  ├─ Structural inconsistencies detection
│  ├─ Kept separate from main AI flow
│  └─ Output: Pattern-based findings
│
├─ AI ANALYSIS ✅ (LLM-based)
│  ├─ Clinical gaps: ai_gaps.csv (5-7 rows)
│  ├─ Coverage gaps: coverage_gaps (24-26 rows)
│  ├─ Contradictions: ai_contradictions.csv (6 rows)
│  └─ All with Kenya health context
│
├─ DEDUPLICATION ✅
│  ├─ Combine clinical + coverage gaps
│  ├─ Run OpenAI similarity check (0.85 threshold)
│  ├─ October: 0 duplicates found → 29 output
│  └─ August: 7 duplicates found → 25 output
│
├─ MERGING ✅
│  ├─ Output: comprehensive_gaps_analysis.csv (DEDUPLICATED)
│  ├─ Output: ai_contradictions.csv (contradictions)
│  └─ All with categorization & Kenya context
│
└─ HISTORICAL TRACKING ✅
   ├─ unique_tracker scans ALL previous runs
   ├─ Accumulates unique gaps: 144 total
   ├─ Accumulates unique contradictions: 25 total
   └─ Outputs: all_unique_gaps_comprehensive.csv (144)
              all_unique_contradictions_comprehensive.csv (25)

RESULT: Every run completes fully with all outputs generated
```

**October run generated:**

- ✅ 5 clinical gaps (ai_gaps.csv)
- ✅ 24 coverage gaps
- ✅ 29 deduplicated total (comprehensive_gaps_analysis.csv)
- ✅ 6 contradictions
- ✅ 144 cumulative unique gaps
- ✅ 25 cumulative unique contradictions

All files created successfully. ✅

## Why Different Runs Have Different Numbers

### August Run (outputs_run_20250827_194421)

```
Fresh Extraction:
  AI Gaps Phase: 7 gaps identified
  Coverage Gaps: ~25 gaps identified
  Total before dedup: 32 gaps

Deduplication:
  Similarity check found: 7 duplicate groups
  Merged down to: 25 unique gaps
  Reduction: 21.9%

Final Output:
  comprehensive_gaps_analysis.csv: 25 gaps (FEWER)
```

### October Run (outputs_run_20251017_140721)

```
Fresh Extraction:
  AI Gaps Phase: 5 gaps identified
  Coverage Gaps: 24 gaps identified
  Total before dedup: 29 gaps

Deduplication:
  Similarity check found: 0 duplicate groups
  Kept all: 29 unique gaps
  Reduction: 0.0%

Final Output:
  comprehensive_gaps_analysis.csv: 29 gaps (MORE)
```

### Why the Difference?

1. **LLM Non-Determinism**: Different clinical gap identifications

   - August identified 7 clinical gaps
   - October identified 5 clinical gaps
   - Same seed=42 & temp=0, but LLM still varies slightly

2. **Coverage Analysis Varies**: Different structural gap detection

   - August: ~25 coverage gaps
   - October: 24 coverage gaps

3. **Deduplication Efficiency**: Different similarity results
   - August: 7 near-duplicate clinical descriptions → merged
   - October: All 29 gaps sufficiently unique → no merging

**This is EXPECTED and NORMAL** - each run is independent

## What Gets Exported to App

### Streamlit App Loading Strategy (Priority-Based)

**GAPS:**

```
Try in order:
1. comprehensive_gaps_analysis.csv (29 deduplicated, clean) ← PREFERRED
2. all_gaps_before_dedup.csv (29 backup)
3. ai_gaps.csv (5 clinical only, fallback)

App displays: First available (usually #1 = 29 gaps)
Status: ✅ Loaded successfully
```

**CONTRADICTIONS:**

```
Try in order:
1. all_unique_contradictions_comprehensive.csv (25 cumulative) ← PREFERRED
2. ai_contradictions.csv (6 current run, fallback)

App displays: First available (usually #1 = 25 contradictions)
Status: ✅ Loaded successfully
```

### Why Priority Loading?

✅ **Maximizes data shown** - Gets most complete version  
✅ **Handles missing files** - Falls back gracefully  
✅ **No data loss** - Always uses best available  
✅ **Consistent experience** - Same source per run
